# Apollo GraphQL Lift-off Series

This repository is dedicated to my progress through the [Apollo GraphQL Lift-off tutorial series](https://www.apollographql.com/tutorials/browse). This series is designed to introduce developers to building GraphQL APIs using Apollo Server.

## About Apollo GraphQL Lift-off Series

The Lift-off series is a comprehensive set of tutorials from Apollo GraphQL that guides learners through the process of creating a full-fledged GraphQL API from scratch. The series covers various aspects of GraphQL, including schema design, resolvers, integration with databases, and more.

## Progress

Here, I'll track my progress through the series. Each part of the series will have its own folder or branch within this repository, containing the code and notes I've made along the way.

-   [ ] Lift-off Part 1: Basics of GraphQL in Apollo Server
-   [ ] Lift-off Part 2: Resolvers
-   [ ] Lift-off Part 3: Arguments
-   [ ] Lift-off Part 4: Mutations
        Lift-off series ended

## Installation and Running Projects

Instructions on how to install necessary dependencies and run each project will be provided in the respective folder's README.

## Learning Outcomes

As I progress through the series, I'll list key learning outcomes and concepts that I've mastered.

-   Understanding the basics of GraphQL schemas and type definitions.
-   Learning how to write resolvers in Apollo Server.
-   Integrating a database with a GraphQL API.
-   Learning how to use resolvers and a RESTDataSource to connect app to live data.
-   Learning how to use query variables and arguments to query for one single track.
-   Understanding how to use the parent and args parameters in resolver functions, use arguments in the schema, use resolver chains to resolve data
-   Adding mutations to a schema and learning best practices for mutation responses
